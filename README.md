👋 Hi, I’m Gabriel, I usually go by Gabo.

💻 I’m a Software Engineer at [Mudflap](https://www.mudflapinc.com/), writing Rails.

🌱 I’m learning Golang.

🌐 I speak 🇪🇸 and 🇺🇸 fluently, and a little bit of 🇫🇷 (in the making). 

:octocat: Old GitHub account: [gabo-cs-zz](https://github.com/gabo-cs-zz) (I lost it to 2FA settings 😞).
