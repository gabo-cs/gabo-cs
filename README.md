👋 Ni Hao, my name is Gabriel Coronado, but I go by _Gabo_.

💻 I’m a Software Engineer at [Mudflap](https://www.mudflapinc.com/), writing Ruby on Rails.

🌱 I’m learning Elixir.

🌐 I speak 🇪🇸 and 🇺🇸 fluently, and a little bit of 🇫🇷. 

:octocat: Old GitHub account: [gabo-cs-zz](https://github.com/gabo-cs-zz) (I lost it to 2FA settings 😞).
